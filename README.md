# EXOPLAN

Starting with the first confirmed planet discovered in 1995, we are approaching 5,600 confirmed exoplanets today, and the number will continue to grow along with our knowledge of them, thanks to NASA's James Webb Space Telescope and the future Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.  
Existing traditional educational materials that talk about exoplanets can have drawbacks, such as: not being accessible to everyone, not providing the necessary level of interactivity and engagement, scattered across multiple sources, and being difficult to understand for younger age groups.


EXOPLAN is an app whose mission is to educate students about the wonders and diversity of exoplanets. 

The app consists of 4 main sections:
Exoplanets (objects of observation)
Observatories (subjects of observation)
Quizzes as a game form of knowledge acquisition and testing
Study materials to familiarize you with exoplanets and methods of studying them.
NASA data used in the app can give users an idea of the huge variety of planetary systems in the Universe.
